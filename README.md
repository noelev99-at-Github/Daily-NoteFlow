# Daily NoteFlow – MVP / Version 1

I’ve always been a fan of the spatial logic of physical sticky notes — the way you can move them around to map out ideas in your head. Windows Sticky Notes exists, but I find it disruptive to constantly minimize my browser to view multiple sticky notes on my desktop,  

So I built **Daily NoteFlow** — **sticky notes just one tab away**.

This project was particularly challenging for me because it was my first time working with resizable components, multiple panels, and replicating the behavior of sticky notes in a web environment. On top of that, this was my first react project.

I designed the interface with intuitive simplicity as the primary goal. I believe that for a workflow tool to be truly effective, it should be easy to learn. I’m happy to have accomplished this, creating a web app that users can navigate and utilize at a glance — no tutorial required.

Right now, Daily NoteFlow is a functional MVP, and it already a part of my own daily workflow. While it isn’t "finished," it’s reliable enough to handle my real-world tasks.
