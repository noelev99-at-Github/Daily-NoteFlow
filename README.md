# Daily NoteFlow

I’ve always been a fan of the spatial logic of physical sticky notes — the way you can move them around to map out the flow of ideas in your head. While Windows Sticky Notes exists, I find it disruptive to constantly minimize my browser just to view or manage them. 

So I built Daily NoteFlow — **sticky notes one tab away**.
